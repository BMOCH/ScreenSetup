## General Info
This project is used to set up multiple screens on a canvas. Screens can be placed by clicking on the location and moved around by clicking down and dragging. A screen can be reselected by clicking on it, moved around with the arrow keys, deselected with the escape key, and removed with backspace or delete. The side panel can be used to modify the canvas dimensions along with the properties of the selected screen, such as its top left coordinates, width, height, and rotation.
